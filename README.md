# TheFirstGame
Pong marks the beggining of the first generation of video game console in 1972, it's amazing that forty-six years ago [you needed an entire
team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong) for something that today you can do in your own room in two hours or less isn't it?\
\
That's what you're going to do today following the steps below.

## Setup
  **You will need:**
  - One Arduino Uno Board
  - One MAX7219 Driver
  - One 10 µF Electrolitic Capacitator
  - One 104 pF Ceramic Capacitator
  - One 1388ASR 8x8 Matrix (also works with 1088AS)  
  - One Button
  - One LCD Display (the game should be able to run without it, but features like score keeping will be removed)
  - Two Potentiometers
  - Three 10k Resistors
  - Four Breadboards (if you manage your space with care you need only three of them)
## Instructions
It's the first game ever made, so it's very easy to pick up and play.
### Movement
To go left you turn the knob to the left and the other way around.
### Goal
The first to score three goals on his opponent wins, but for the purpose of this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9SeMFr-97Y&feature=youtu.be) it will only be one goal.
